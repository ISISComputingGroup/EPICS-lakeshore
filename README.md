EPICS support for the Lakeshore 336/350 series controllers 

[Lakeshore 336](http://www.lakeshore.com/products/cryogenic-temperature-controllers/model-336/Pages/Overview.aspx)

[Lakeshore 350](http://www.lakeshore.com/products/cryogenic-temperature-controllers/model-350/Pages/Overview.aspx)

The 336 controller is almost identical to the 350, and the same
software can be used for both. Where the settings do differ this 
module provides generic menu options that apply to both controllers.

The module can also support the extra inputs supplied by the 3062
option card. 

The EPICS support is entirely based on [Asyn](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/) and [Stream Device](http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/).

The module provides support for:

* Reading temperature and raw inputs
* Support for reading 3062 option card inputs
* Setting up channel output parameters such as setpoint and ramp rate
* Reading back channel output parameters
* Support for 4 PID loop outputs, including 2 analog outputs
* Support for setting ZONE parameters for all 4 output channels
* Channel access put_callback support when setting parameters
* Support for setting and reading input sensor descriptions
* Set of CS-Studio BOY screens

### Release history

1-0: 
Original release.

1-1: 
Add support for setting and reading input sensor descriptions (and related GUI OPI changes). 
Factor out common records for input sensors into new template file (lakeshore_input.template). 

### Building lakeshore

The lakeshore336 directory can be build as a standard EPICS support
module. You may have to edit the files in the configure directory
for your local site.

### Building an IOC using lakeshore

Include the lakeshore support in the IOC configure/RELEASE file, and 
either instantiate the EPICS database in the IOC startup script or in a
substitutions file. For example:
```
   file lakeshore336.template
   {
      pattern {P, PORT, ADDR, TEMPSCAN, SCAN}
              {BL9:SE:LS, L0, 0, 1, 5}
   }
```
where the macros are:
```
   P - Base PV name
   PORT - Asyn port name
   ADDR - Asyn port addr
   TEMPSCAN - Scan frequency for the temperatures and raw inputs (eg. 1 second)
   SCAN - Scan frequency for the auxiliary parameters such as output ramp rate (eg. 5 seconds)
```
There are no libraries to link to apart from the usual Asyn and StreamDevice libraries. 

There is an example IOC provided with the module.
